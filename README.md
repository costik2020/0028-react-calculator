# A calculator in React.js 

This is my second Calculator that I developed in React.  
My first calculator is here: [https://github.com/costik2020/0023-calculator-in-react ](https://github.com/costik2020/0023-calculator-in-react) but I while writing the code it got too complex (around 600 lines of code). 
So I decided to scrap it and develop a new calculator that has simpler code and lighter logic. 

This project was done for the purpose of gaining Front End Development Libraries Certification from freeCodeCamp coding bootcamp. 

I added some naughty SASS to it to make it look fun and playful. 
I hope it is not too distracting ;)




## Development notes

Run the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Run the SASS compiler with **watch mode** enabled:

```bash
npx sass src/sass/main.sass src/css/main.css -w
```
